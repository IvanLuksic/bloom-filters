# Bloom-filters
C++ implementations of Bloom filters.

Two fairly simple implementations of Bloom filters.
**School-example** is focused on showing how Bloom filters work and how false positive chance increases.
**Hash-speed-text** is a Bloom filter example that focuses on what impact do different hash functions have on performance of a Bloom filter. Hashes included are murmur3, fnv, md5 and sha1. Tests are run on 100k words, but included are disjunctive txt files containing: 1k, 5k, 20k, 50k, 100k and 800k words, so it is easily interchanged.
